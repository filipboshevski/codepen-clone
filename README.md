## CodePen Clone by Filip Boshevski

As the title suggests, this application is a clone from the original CodePen, of course, with lesser features, created with React.Js for Front End, Firebase for Authentication and Firestore as a Backend Database. It has all the features of the original one, with one con, only one document per user per login and user customization and other perks excluded naturally. I built it all by myself with the CodeMirror library which saved me tons of time with a premade text editor.

It uses Redux and Redux-Saga for fetching data from the database and managing local state with Reselect to select data from the Redux store. It has a login and signup option using Firebase and Firestore to store the authentication and user data as well as the source Document saved from the application. I hope you like it. :D
